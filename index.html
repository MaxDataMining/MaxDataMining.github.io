       K-Nearest Neighbors, or KNN, is a supervised non-parametric lazy algorithm, first proposed by Evelyn Fix and J.L. Hodges in 1951 
       The basic premise of KNN is that there is an initial data point/sample, and we want to find a new sample. 
       In this case, we calculate the k nearest neighbors (with k being a positive number). Thus, if k=1, then the 
       new point is assigned to the single closest neighbor. If k=2, the sample is assigned to the two closest neighbors, and so on.
       KNN can be used for both classification and regression. For classification, a new sample is assigned to a class by majority vote,
       that is, the most frequently-shown class among the sample's k neighbors. For regression, a sample's k nearest neigbors are calculated,
       and the value is given as an average.
       
       The most common measurement for KNN is Euclidean Distance. The math formula is given below:
       
                                D(xi, xj) = √ ∑<sup>k</sup><sub>i=1</sub>(xi - xj)<sup>2</sup>
                
       Where xi and xj are the initially-labeled/input sample and the new sample (also referred to as a test sample) respectively, 
       and k is the nearest neighbor to the new sample.
                                      
       KNN is non-parametric because there is no assumption about the data fits any sort of parameterized distribution. KNN is a popular algorithm to use 
       for machine learning because it is simple and because the training time is very quick, due to the method being a lazy algorithm. 
       That is, all the data is stored during the training phase, but the algorithm does not learn on the data until it needs to be classified. 
       This is good for when the distribution of the data is unknown (as is the case for a lot of real-world data), or in experiments when a quick classification is needed. 
       
       The status of KNN as a lazy algorithm also comes with disadvantages. One disadvantage is the calculation complexity. This stems from 
       KNN's retention of all the training data until testing. The algorithm calculates the distance between every sample within the training set
       This means that if there is a lot of data, the calculations of similarity between two training samples will take a long time. 
       Another disadvantage is that because KNN does not learn on the training set, it is less able to predict upon any newly-introduced data. 
       In addition, the model would not be able to handle noisy data too well. This is why choosing a large enough value of k is important, 
       because it will mitigate the effect of noise upon data. This may lead to the model undefitting the data (little similarity between training
       samples and predicted outcome), if the k is too big. If the k is too small, the result could be an overfit of the data, 
       meaning that the model cannot learn on any new data introduced. Lastly, all the samples are treated equally. The concept of majority voting results in 
       the most frequently-found attributes dominating the model at each new iteration. And these attributes would not always be relevant to the problem at hand.
       
       The following is a simple flow chart of the classification process by KNN. It is based off Fig. 4 of the paper by Al-Faiz and Miry
       (http://dx.doi.org/10.5772/48531)
                                            start of iteration
                                                     ↓
                                           select and define k 
                                                     ↓
                         compute the Euclidean distance between the initial and new samples
                                                     ↓
                                             sort the distances
                                                     ↓
          -                      select the k nearest neighbors to the new sample
                                                     ↓
                                       apply the majority vote to all the neighbors
                                                     ↓
                                              end of iteration
                                             
       
       There are a number of improvements that have been proposed and implemented to make KNN more efficient:
       
       1. One way is to filter out any irrelevant and noisy attributes during distance calculation. This is done via wrapper methods (searching each feature set for a good subset), 
       genetic algorithms (which mimic the process of evolution by natural selection), or by weighting each attribute differently (Jiang <i>et. al.</i>). 
       
       2. Another way to improve KNN is to search for the best k value, and this means trying out different k values to find the best one.
       and using it as the test value (Jiang <i>et. al.</i>). 
       
       3. A third way is to weight the vote of a test sample's k neighbors based on their distance from that sample. A similar method makes use of
       both KNN and Naive Bayes (another lazy algorithm) and makes the weighting within the local space of the test sample. A Naive Bayes is
       trained after a sample is classifed, using the sample's k nearest neigbors (Jiang <i>et. al.</i>).
       
       For our experiment, we intend to use a combination of genetic algorithms and KNN, in what is known as GKNN (Suguna and Thanushkodi, 2010). 
       This method was shown to give better performance upon a real-world medical dataset. 
       The algorithm should give a similarly good performance upon the educational datasets we will be using as a case study.
       The basic premise of genetic algorithms is that they mimic the process of evolution by natural selection. The training samples (genes) 
       are grouped into strings called chromosomes and the entire collection of strings for the iteration is known as a population. The value
       from the calculation of distance is known as the fitness value. Reproduction is generating new solutions at the next iteration, from the
       previous solutions. The populations with the highest fitness are selected. The crossover operation is when two different populations combine
       to generate child solutions. Mutation is when a position on a chromosome is altered at random (the value is replaced by a number between 0 and 9).
       
       
       The following is an example of the pseudocode used for the combination of KNN and genetic algorithm, from Suguna and Thanushkodi (2010).
       
          1. Choose k number of samples from the training set to generate initial population (p1).
          2. Calculate the distance between training samples in each chromosome and testing samples, as fitness value.
          3. Choose the chromosome with highest fitness value as global maximum (Gmax).
              a. For i = 1 to L do
                  i. Perform reproduction
                  ii. Apply the crossover operator.
                  iii. Perform mutation and get the new population. (p2)
                  iv. Calculate the local maximum (Lmax).
                  v. If Gmax < Lmax then
                        a. Gmax = Lmax;
                        b. p1 = p2;
              b. Repeat
          4. Output – the chromosome which obtains Gmax has the optimum K-neighbors and the corresponding 
             labels are the classification results.
