      K-Nearest Neighbors, or KNN, is a non-parametric lazy algorithm. That is, the algorithm does not make the assumption that the data
      fits any sort of parameterized distribution. K-NN is a popular algorithm to use for machine learning because it is simple and 
      because the training time is very quick. This has to do with K-NN being a lazy algorithm. That is, the data is stored during
      the training phase, but the algorithm does not learn on the data until after classification. Futhermore, the entire training data
      is used.
