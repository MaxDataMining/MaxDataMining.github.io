       K-Nearest Neighbors, or KNN, is a supervised non-parametric lazy algorithm, first proposed by Evelyn Fix and J.L. Hodges in 1951 and improved upon by Thomas Cover in 1968. 
       The basic premise of KNN is that 
       
                                      
       KNN is non-parametric because there is no assumption about the data fits any sort of parameterized distribution. KNN is a popular algorithm to use 
       for machine learning because it is simple and because the training time is very quick, due to the method being a lazy algorithm. 
       That is, all the data is stored during the training phase, but the algorithm does not learn on the data until after classification. 
       This is good for cases when the distribution of the data is unknown, or in experiments when a quick classification is needed. 
       
       The status of KNN as a lazy algorithm also comes with disadvantages. One disadvantage is the calculation complexity. This stems from 
       KNN's retention of all the training data until testing. If there is a lot of data, the calculations of similarity between the training
       and test sets will take a long time.
